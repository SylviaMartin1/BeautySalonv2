## 	ðŸ’ [Introduction](##Introduction)
This application uses a simple menu system paired with a utility called 'ScannerInput' to give users the choice between:

- Adding clients
- Listing clients
- Updating clients
- Deleting clients
- Clearing all clients
- Checking if there are clients
- Searching for clients by their first name, id, last name, street, county, email, phone or allergy
- Adding appointments
- Listing confirmed appointments
- Updating appointments
- Deleting appointments
- Searching appointments by their Id, time, date, treatment, cost, rating
- Exiting the app

The 'ScannerInput' class avails of the Java.Util.Scanner class and ensures that in the event the user enters the wrong datatype, they are prompted to enter the correct datatype and thus the program doesn't crash and their error is handled delicately. The utility also allows the program to bypass a Java Scanner class bug where the class doesn't flush its buffers correctly after reading an Int or Double. I created this project because:

- I wanted to become more proficient in operating the Gradle Build System
- I wanted to become even more familiar with using IntelliJ (the IDE that the program was built in). I built the project in IntelliJ because IntelliJ was actually created in 2011 by Jetbrains, the creators of Kotlin.
- I wanted to fine-tune my Kotlin programming skills because:
    - I have built projects in the Java programming language, another object-oriented language. Kotlin is interoperable with Java, runs on the Java Virtual Machine          and even relies on some Java Class Libraries.
    - kotlin is an evolution of Java but is more concise with a cleaner syntax.
    - kotlin offers null safety.
    - kotlin is the 2nd most popular JVM language.
    - kotlin is often used in android development, server-side development and mobile multiplatform development.
    - kotlin is used by many large companies including Netflix, Trello, Uber and Pinterest
